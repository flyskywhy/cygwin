# Setup a public repository
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Setup a public GIT repository, that is, one that has no attached working
# copy and you typically only push into it and pull from it. You need to run
# this command before you will be able to push into the repository for the
# first time, but you will be also unable to pull from the repository until
# you push into it at first.
#
# Therefore the workflow is to first init a regular private repository, then
# use this command to create the public one, then add the appropriate remote
# branch (`cg-branch-add origin ...`) in your private repository and then
# push to the public repository.
#
# Use `cg-init` if you want to instead create a new GIT project.
#
# The command will create the repository to reside in REPOSITORY (either local
# path or git+ssh URL; the directory must not exist before calling this
# command). By default, it will be world-readable, but writable only by you. If
# you want to make it possible for multiple users to push, create a group for
# them and use the '-g' parameter, which will make `cg-admin-setuprepo` set up
# the permissions properly.
#
# Note that in case you are using cg-admin-setuprepo with SSH URL instead of
# a local path, you need a full shell access at the remote machine, the
# restricted git shell access is not enough.
#
# The repository will also be set up so that `git update-server-info` will
# be automagically re-ran after each push, in short making it suitable for
# HTTP access.
#
# Note that you might need to do other additional steps, like touching the
# 'git daemon-export-ok' file if you want to make the repository accessible
# by the git daemon (serving the 'git://...' URIs).
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -g GROUP:: Specify group ownership for the repository
#	Name of the UNIX group covering the users authorized to push into
#	the repository. If unspecified, only you (who ran this command) will
#	have write (push) access.
#
# NOTES
# -----
# It may happen that you are using version of GIT missing the default
# post-update hook, or that the relevant template hooks are not available
# on your system or with your GIT installation. In that case, in order to
# have your repository properly accessible with HTTP, you need to add this
# to .git/hooks/post-update (and then make it eXecutable):
#
#	#!/bin/sh
#	exec git update-server-info

# Testsuite: TODO
