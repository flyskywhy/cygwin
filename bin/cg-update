# Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes the branch name as an argument, defaulting to 'origin'.
#
# This is similar to running cg-fetch and cg-merge commands successively.
# Please refer to the documentation of those commands for more details
# about the operation. Note that if you are not doing own development
# but only following some project, it is recommended to use this command
# instead of `cg-fetch` + `cg-merge` since `cg-update` can handle some
# additional corner cases (in particular, if the remote branch rebases,
# `cg-update` will fast-forward instead of doing a tree merge and diverging).
#
# Note that in the GIT newspeak, the operation being performed by cg-update
# is now called 'pull', even though in the past, 'pull' was the name for
# the operation being now done by cg-fetch, which is even still aliased
# to cg-pull. Please do not let this confuse you. (Cogito won't call this
# 'update' operation 'pull', since about everyone but GIT and BK users uses
# it in the 'fetch' meaning.)
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -f:: Force the complete fetch even if the heads are the same.
#	Force the complete fetch even if the heads are the same.
#
# --squash:: Use "squash" merge to record pending commits as a single merge commit
#	"Squash" merge - condense all the to-be-merged commits to a single
#	merge commit. This is not to be used lightly; see the cg-merge
#	documentation for further details.
#
# -v:: Enable verbosity
#	Display more verbose output - most notably list all the files
#	touched by the pulled changes.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
# -----------
# CGFETCH_FLAGS::
#	Additional flags to pass cg-fetch (useful e.g. for -v -v).

# Testsuite: Largely covered (t9210-update, incomplete coverage; missing:
# passing the -f, --squash options and CGFETCH_FLAGS)
