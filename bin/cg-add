#
# Add new files to the repository
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
# for addition to the GIT repository at the next commit. Those files
# are denoted by 'A' in the `cg-status` list. You can add `cg-rm`oved
# files to undo the removal (use `cg-restore` if the file is already
# deleted from the working copy as well); you can undo additions in
# an analogous way using `cg-rm`.
#
# The command will fail if one of the given files does not exist.
#
# Note that directories never have to be added to the repository, and are
# not tracked on their own. That means, you cannot currently add an empty
# directory to 'Cogito'. The reason for this is that 'Cogito' manages
# content and empty directories have no content. Directories are added
# automatically when adding files inside them, or you can add all files in
# a directory using cg-add -r.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -a::	Add all untracked files
#	Add all files in the repository that are currently untracked. Useful
#	when there were some random files added/removed (e.g. by some
#	third-party application) and you want to get the repository in sync:
#	just use `cg-rm -a && cg-add -a`. Note that contrary to `cg-add -r .`,
#	this will not re-add `cg-rm`oved files.
#
# -N::	Only update the lowlevel cache file
#	Only update the cache: do not copy the data into the object database.
#	This is for special purposes when you might not actually _have_ any
#	object database. This option is normally not interesting.
#
# -r::	Add files recursively
#	If you pass cg-add this flag and any directory names, it will try
#	to add files in those directories recursively (with regard to your
#	ignore rules - see `cg-status` for a more detailed description of
#	those). See also above for more notes about cg-add vs. directories.

# Testsuite: Partial (used in many tests but a dedicated testsuite is missing)
