# Clone a remote repository
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# This clones a remote GIT repository and checks it out locally.
#
# Takes a parameter specifying the location of the source repository and an
# optional second parameter specifying the destination. If the second
# parameter is omitted, the basename of the source repository is used as the
# destination.
#
# For detailed description of the location of the source repository format
# (available protocols, specifying different remote branch, etc) please see
# the `cg-branch-add` documentation.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -b::	Create a bare repository - do not check out working copy
#	Create only the bare repository, without a working copy attached;
#	this is useful e.g. for public repository mirrors. `cg-clone`
#	is to `cg-init` as `cg-clone -b` is to `cg-admin-setuprepo`.
#	(Still, if you are setting up a public or a central repository
#	other people will push into, it might be more practical to just
#	`cg-admin-setuprepo` it and then populate it with `cg-push`
#	from the other side.)
#
# -l::	"Borrow" the object database when cloning locally
#	Instead of hardlinking all the objects, set up an "alternate"
#	record pointing at the source object database; this will cause
#	any objects not found locally to be looked up remotely, which
#	effectively eliminates the need to copy/hardlink the objects
#	around. This is suitable for very fast cloning of arbitrarily
#	big repositories, but your repository will become largely useless
#	if the source repository disappears or gets damaged (note that
#	it is generally BAD IDEA to prune the original repository if any
#	repository is borrowing objects from it).  The choice is yours.
#
# --reference PATH:: "Borrow" the object database from a third-party source
#	This does the same thing as '-l' but instead of borrowing the
#	objects from the source repository, it borrows them from yet
#	another local repository. E.g. if you have Linus' kernel repository
#	cloned locally and now want to clone akpm's repository, you can
#	do something like
#
#		cg-clone --reference /path/to/linus/repo git://kernel.org/akpm/repo
#
#	and it will download and keep only the objects that are really
#	missing. Same considerations and warnings on the third-party source
#	as in the case of '-l' apply. Also, you can reference only local
#	repositories.
#
# -s::	Clone into the current directory
#	Clone in the current directory instead of creating a new one.
#	Specifying both -s and a destination directory makes no sense.
#
# NOTES
# -----
# If the clone has been interrupted for any reason, do not panic, calmly
# cd to the destination directory and run `cg-fetch`, which will in this case
# restart the initial clone. Chances are that you will not actually download
# any duplicate data. (At the time of writing this, the chances aren't for
# the native git protocol and ssh, but this may change in the future).
#
# EXAMPLE USAGE
# -------------
# If you want to clone the Cogito repository, you can say:
#
#	$ cg-clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git
#
# and it will be cloned to the 'cogito' subdirectory of the current directory.
#
# To clone the 'next' branch of the Git repository, do e.g.:
#
#	$ cg-clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git#next

# Testsuite: Checked as part of t-9105-fetch-local but tests for some features
# are missing.

cloning in this repository, the clone has been interrupted; you can restart
it by issuing this command (it's enough as-is):
