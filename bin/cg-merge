# Merge a branch to the current branch
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Takes a parameter identifying the branch to be merged, defaulting
# to 'origin'.
#
# This command merges all changes currently in the given branch to your
# current branch. This can produce a merging commit on your branch sticking
# the two branch together (so-called 'tree merge'). However in case there
# are no changes in your branch that wouldn't be in the remote branch, no
# merge commit is done and commit pointer of your branch is just updated
# to the last commit on the remote branch (so-called 'fast-forward merge').
#
# In case of conflicts being generated by the merge, you have to examine
# the tree (cg-merge will tell you which files contain commits; the commits
# are denoted by rcsmerge-like markers <<<<, ====, and >>>>) and then do
# `cg-commit` yourself. `cg-commit` will know that you are committing a merge
# and will record it properly.
#
# Note that when you are merging remote branches, `cg-merge` will use them
# in the state they are currently at in your repository. If you want to
# fetch the latest changes from the remote repository, use `cg-fetch`. If you
# want to fetch the changes and then merge them to your branch, use the command
# `cg-update`.
#
# Also note that if you have local changes in your tree that you did not
# commit, cg-merge will always preserve them when fast-forwarding. When doing
# a tree merge, it will preserve them if they don't conflict with the merged
# changes, and report an error otherwise. In short, it should do the Right
# Thing (tm), never lose your local changes and never let them mix up with
# the merge.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# -b BASE_COMMIT:: Specify the base commit for the merge
#	Parameter specifies the base commit for the merge. Otherwise, the
#	least common ancestor is automatically selected.
#
# -j:: Join current branch with BRANCH_NAME
#	Join the current branch and BRANCH_NAME together. This makes sense
#	when the branches have no common history, meaning they are actually
#	not branches related at all as far as GIT is concerned. Merging such
#	branches might be a user error and you well may be doing something
#	you do not want; but equally likely, you may actually WANT to join
#	the projects together, which is what this option does.
#
# -n:: Disable autocommitting
#	Parameter specifies that you want to have tree merge never
#	autocommitted, but want to review and commit it manually. This will
#	basically make cg-merge always behave like there were conflicts
#	during the merge.
#
# --squash:: Use "squash" merge to record pending commits as a single merge commit
#	"Squash" merge - condense all the to-be-merged commits to a single
#	merge commit. This means "throw away history of the branch I'm
#	merging", essentially like in CVS or SVN, with the same problem -
#	re-merging with that branch later will cause trouble. This is not
#	recommended unless you actually really want to flatten the history
#	of the merged branch, e.g. when merging topical branches to your
#	mainline (you want to have the logical change you developed in
#	a branch as a single "do it" commit instead of a sequence of
#	"do it I", "fix it", "do it II", "fix it II", "fix it III" commits
#	like you would get with a regular merge).
#
# -v:: Enable verbosity
#	Display more verbose output - most notably list all the files
#	touched by the merged changes.
#
# HOOKS
# -----
# '.git/hooks/merge-pre' BRANCH BASE CURHEAD MERGEDHEAD MERGETYPE::
#	If the file exists and is executable it will be executed right
#	before the merge itself happens. The merge is cancelled if the script
#	returns non-zero exit code.
#	 - MERGETYPE is either "forward", "squash", or "tree".
#
# '.git/hooks/merge-post' BRANCH BASE CURHEAD MERGEDHEAD MERGETYPE STATUS::
#	If the file exists and is executable it will be executed after
#	the merge is done.
#	 - MERGETYPE is either "forward", "squash", or "tree".
#	 - For 'forward', the STATUS is always "ok", while for "squash"
#	   and "tree" the STATUS can be "localchanges", "conflicts",
#	   "nocommit", or "ok".

# Developer's documentation:
#
# ENVIRONMENT
# -----------
# _cg_orig_head::
#	The original commit ID of the to-be-merged branch, if cg-merge
#	is called right after fetch. This is used to do better decision
#	about whether to fast-forward or tree-merge.

# Testsuite: Largely covered (t92xx testsuite family, incomplete coverage;
# missing: hooks, -n, -b, --squash)
