# Reset the state of the working tree
# Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005
#
# Reverts the working tree to a consistent state before any changes to it
# (including merges etc.) were done. This command will rebuild the state
# of the tree according to the commit of .git/refs/heads/master, so if your
# working tree got into basically any inconsistent state, this will cure it.
#
# Basically, this is the opposite of `cg-commit` in some sense.
#
# This command is complementary to `cg-restore`, which only brings
# individual files in sync with their state at the time of the
# last commit.
#
# OPTIONS
# -------
# --adds-removes:: Only reset info about added and removed files
#	Reset ONLY the so-called "index" file. This effectively means that
#	any adds and removes you did will be unrecorded (but if you removed
#	the file physically as well, that will not be undone - run
#	'cg-restore' to restore it physically afterwards).
