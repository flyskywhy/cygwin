<a name="id4021306"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The <a href="GtkCTree.html" title="GtkCTree"><span class="type">GtkCTree</span></a> widget is used for showing a hierarchical tree 
to the user, for example a directory tree.
</p>
<p>
The tree is internally represented as a set of <a href="GtkCTree.html#GtkCTreeNode"><span class="type">GtkCTreeNode</span></a> structures.
</p>
<p>
The interface has much in common with the <a href="GtkCList.html" title="GtkCList"><span class="type">GtkCList</span></a> widget: rows (nodes)
can be selected by the user etc.
</p>
<p> 
Positions in the tree are often indicated by two arguments, a
parent and a sibling, both <a href="GtkCTree.html#GtkCTreeNode"><span class="type">GtkCTreeNode</span></a> pointers. If the parent
is <code class="literal">NULL</code>, the position is at the root of the tree and if the sibling
is <code class="literal">NULL</code>, it will be the last child of parent, otherwise it will be
inserted just before the sibling.
</p>
<p>
GtkCTree has been deprecated since GTK+ 2.0 and should not be used
in newly written code. Use <a href="GtkTreeView.html" title="GtkTreeView"><span class="type">GtkTreeView</span></a> instead.
