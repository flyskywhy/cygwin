Changes in OpenJade 1.3

* The SGML backend will no emit linebreaks when used as -t sgml-raw.

* Jade can bind variables to arbitrary values on the command line. 

* The prlabs1 module of the SGML property set is supported.

* Style sheet extensions.dsl lists all known
  external procedures ready for easy inclusion
  as an external-specification.

* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::expt"
  allows to form integral powers of quantities.
  
* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::sgml-parse"
  allows to parse wrt. an architecture.

* Jade supports force! for inherited characteristics.

* Jade supports character properties.
 
* Jade supports special-query-expressions.

* Jade can bind variables to string values on the command line.

* All standard color spaces supported. 

* Jade ignores duplicate keywords in make expressions, as 
  mandated by DSSSL.

* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::language"
  to create a language object by reference to a POSIX locale.
 
* Language-dependent procedures of the expression language:
  language?, current-language, declare-default-language, 
  with-language, define-language, char<?, char>?, char<=?,
  char>=?, char-ci=?, char-ci<?, char-ci>?, char-ci<=?,
  char-ci>=?, char-upcase, char-downcase, string-ci=?,
  string-equiv?, string<?, string>?, string<=?, string>=?,
  string-ci<?, string-ci>?, string-ci<=?, string-ci>=?.

* The style-sheet.dtd derived from the dsssl architecture
  has been extended (in a backwards compatible way) to

  Jade. The public identifier for the dtd is 

  "-//OpenJade//DTD DSSSL Style Sheet//EN" 
  
* char-repertoire, add-name-chars and add-separator-chars
  declaration element type forms are supported. When given
  the -s cmdline flag, Jade doesn't use its builtin 
  character repertoire.
  
* Most of the derived procedures in the query language:
  current-root, node-list-reduce, node-list-contains?,
  node-list-remove-duplicates, node-list-union, 
  node-list-intersection, node-list-difference, 
  node-list-symmetric-difference, node-list-union-map,
  node-list-some?, node-list-every?, node-list-filter,
  node-list->list, node-list-tail, node-list-head,
  node-list-sublist, node-list-count, node-list-last,

  tree-before, property-lookup, select-by-property, 
  select-by-null-property, select-by-missing-property,
  attribute, referent, q-element, q-class, q-sdata.

* The HTML and MIF backends are now enabled by default.

* The TeX backend has support for PDF bookmarks. This is
  supported by the new version of jadetex which is included.

  type forms are supported.
