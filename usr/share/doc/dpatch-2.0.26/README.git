Staying up-to-date
==================

dpatch is now maintained in 'git'. GNU Arch or Alioth CVS is not updated anymore at all.

To get the very latest of dpatch, install the git-core package, and issue
the following commands:

$ git-clone git://git.debian.org/git/dpatch/dpatch.git

Then you should have the latest sources in dpatch. If you want to
update the tree, cd into the directory, and issue `git-pull.
