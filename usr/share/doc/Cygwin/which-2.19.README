which
-------------------------------------------
GNU Which prints out the full path of the executables that bash(1) would
execute when the passed program names would have been entered on the
shell prompt. It uses the exact same algorithm as bash. Tildes and a dot
in the PATH are now expanded to the full path by default. Options allow
users to print "~/*" or "./*" and/or to print all executables that match
any directory in the PATH.

Build instructions:
  unpack which-2.19-1-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./which-2.19-1.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/which-2.19-1-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/which-2.19-1.tar.bz2

Or use 'cygport which-2.19-1.cygport prep' to get a patched source
directory.

To find out the files included in the binary distribution, you can
use "cygcheck -l which", or browse the listing for the appropriate
version at <http://cygwin.com/packages/>.

Port Notes:

----- version 2.19-1 -----
New upstream release.

Removed the local patch for the problem with the two leading slashes
for a UNC path being replaced with one slash, as reported in
http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2008-01/msg00018.html. Upstream has
included a fix for this issue.

----- version 2.18-2 -----
Fixed a problem with the two leading slashes for a UNC path being
replaced with one slash, as reported in
http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2008-01/msg00018.html.

Switched to using PATH_MAX instead of hard-coded 256.

----- version 2.18-1 -----
This is the initial Cygwin release of GNU which; previous versions
of which distributed with Cygwin were not from this source.

Compiled with one patch to use access() for checking whether a
directory contains an executable, just as bash does.
