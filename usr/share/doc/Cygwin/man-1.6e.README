Build instructions:
  unpack man-1.6e-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
        unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./man-1.6e-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/man-1.6e-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/man-1.6e-X.tar.bz2

Or use 'cygport ./man-1.6e-X.cygport prep' to get a patched source directory

To find out the files included in the binary distribution, you can
use "cygcheck -l man", or browse the listing for the appropriate version
at <http://cygwin.com/packages/>.

Cygwin specific changes:
========================

 o added m and 8c to the default man sections list, cygwin has man pages
   in directories /usr/share/man/man8c and /usr/X11R6/man/manm
 o fixed italian man page
 o added /usr/X11R6/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/local/man to the default
   manpath in makewhatis
 o postinstall script adds symlinks from man to manpath for binary and
   manpage
   
Additionally the following things have been changed since the interim 
version man-1.5m2-1:

 o The following two lines in man.conf

   NROFF		/usr/bin/nroff -c -mandoc
   PAGER		/usr/bin/less -isrR
   
   seem to fix the output of ESC sequences
   

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Certain versions of the FHS recommend putting formatted versions of

 /usr/.../share/man/[locale/]manx/page.x 
 
into

 /var/cache/man/.../[locale/]catx/page.x.

The keyword FHS in man.conf will cause this behaviour and is now the default.
Explicitly given catdirs override. See comments in the man.conf file.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
