9.1 Structured Documentation 
</h2>

<p>
Most of the small changes to the <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span> markup have been made
    with an eye to divorcing the markup from the presentation, making
    both a bit more maintainable.  Over the course of 1998, a large
    number of changes were made with exactly this in mind; previously,
    changes had been made but in a less systematic manner and with
    more concern for not needing to update the existing content.  The
    result has been a highly structured and semantically loaded markup
    language implemented in <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span>.  With almost no basic <span class="TeX">TeX</span> or
    <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span> markup in use, however, the markup syntax is about the
    only evidence of <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span> in the actual document sources.

<p>
One side effect of this is that while we've been able to use
    standard ``engines'' for manipulating the documents, such as
    <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span> and <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span>2HTML, most of the actual transformations have
    been created specifically for Python.  The <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span> document
    classes and <span class="LaTeX">LaTeX</span>2HTML support are both complete implementations
    of the specific markup designed for these documents.

<p>
Combining highly customized markup with the somewhat esoteric
    systems used to process the documents leads us to ask some
    questions:  Can we do this more easily?  and, Can we do this
    better?  After a great deal of discussion with the community, we
    have determined that actively pursuing modern structured
    documentation systems is worth some investment of time.

<p>
There appear to be two real contenders in this arena: the Standard
    General Markup Language (SGML), and the Extensible Markup Language
    (XML).  Both of these standards have advantages and disadvantages,
    and many advantages are shared.

<p>
SGML offers advantages which may appeal most to authors,
    especially those using ordinary text editors.  There are also
    additional abilities to define content models.  A number of
    high-quality tools with demonstrated maturity are available, but
    most are not free; for those which are, portability issues remain
    a problem.

<p>
The advantages of XML include the availability of a large number
    of evolving tools.  Unfortunately, many of the associated
    standards are still evolving, and the tools will have to follow
    along.  This means that developing a robust tool set that uses
    more than the basic XML 1.0 recommendation is not possible in the
    short term.  The promised availability of a wide variety of
    high-quality tools which support some of the most important
    related standards is not immediate.  Many tools are likely to be
    free, and the portability issues of those which are, are not
    expected to be significant.

<p>
It turns out that converting to an XML or SGML system holds
    promise for translators as well; how much can be done to ease the
    burden on translators remains to be seen, and may have some impact
    on the schema and specific technologies used.

<p>
XXX Eventual migration to XML.

<p>
The documentation will be moved to XML in the future, and tools
    are being written which will convert the documentation from the
    current format to something close to a finished version, to the
    extent that the desired information is already present in the
    documentation.  Some XSLT stylesheets have been started for
    presenting a preliminary XML version as HTML, but the results are
    fairly rough.

<p>
The timeframe for the conversion is not clear since there doesn't
    seem to be much time available to work on this, but the apparent
    benefits are growing more substantial at a moderately rapid pace.
