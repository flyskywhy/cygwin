8.1 Thread State and the Global Interpreter Lock
         
</h1>

<p>
<a id='l2h-911' xml:id='l2h-911'></a>

<p>
The Python interpreter is not fully thread safe.  In order to support
multi-threaded Python programs, there's a global lock that must be
held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects.
Without the lock, even the simplest operations could cause problems in
a multi-threaded program: for example, when two threads simultaneously
increment the reference count of the same object, the reference count
could end up being incremented only once instead of twice.

<p>
Therefore, the rule exists that only the thread that has acquired the
global interpreter lock may operate on Python objects or call Python/C
API functions.  In order to support multi-threaded Python programs,
the interpreter regularly releases and reacquires the lock -- by
default, every 100 bytecode instructions (this can be changed with
<a id='l2h-884' xml:id='l2h-884'></a><tt class="function">sys.setcheckinterval()</tt>).  The lock is also released and
reacquired around potentially blocking I/O operations like reading or
writing a file, so that other threads can run while the thread that
requests the I/O is waiting for the I/O operation to complete.

<p>
The Python interpreter needs to keep some bookkeeping information
separate per thread -- for this it uses a data structure called
<tt class="ctype">PyThreadState</tt><a id='l2h-912' xml:id='l2h-912'></a>.  There's one global
variable, however: the pointer to the current
<tt class="ctype">PyThreadState</tt><a id='l2h-913' xml:id='l2h-913'></a> structure.  While most
thread packages have a way to store ``per-thread global data,''
Python's internal platform independent thread abstraction doesn't
support this yet.  Therefore, the current thread state must be
manipulated explicitly.

<p>
This is easy enough in most cases.  Most code manipulating the global
interpreter lock has the following simple structure:

<p>
<div class="verbatim"><pre>
Save the thread state in a local variable.
Release the interpreter lock.
...Do some blocking I/O operation...
Reacquire the interpreter lock.
Restore the thread state from the local variable.
</pre></div>

<p>
This is so common that a pair of macros exists to simplify it:

<p>
<div class="verbatim"><pre>
Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
...Do some blocking I/O operation...
Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
</pre></div>

<p>
The
Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS<a id='l2h-914' xml:id='l2h-914'></a>
macro opens a new block and declares a hidden local variable; the
Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS<a id='l2h-915' xml:id='l2h-915'></a>
macro closes the block.  Another advantage of using these two macros
is that when Python is compiled without thread support, they are
defined empty, thus saving the thread state and lock manipulations.

<p>
When thread support is enabled, the block above expands to the
following code:

<p>
<div class="verbatim"><pre>
    PyThreadState *_save;

    _save = PyEval_SaveThread();
    ...Do some blocking I/O operation...
    PyEval_RestoreThread(_save);
</pre></div>

<p>
Using even lower level primitives, we can get roughly the same effect
as follows:

<p>
<div class="verbatim"><pre>
    PyThreadState *_save;

    _save = PyThreadState_Swap(NULL);
    PyEval_ReleaseLock();
    ...Do some blocking I/O operation...
    PyEval_AcquireLock();
    PyThreadState_Swap(_save);
</pre></div>

<p>
There are some subtle differences; in particular,
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_RestoreThread()</tt><a id='l2h-916' xml:id='l2h-916'></a> saves
and restores the value of the  global variable
<tt class="cdata">errno</tt><a id='l2h-917' xml:id='l2h-917'></a>, since the lock manipulation does not
guarantee that <tt class="cdata">errno</tt> is left alone.  Also, when thread support
is disabled,
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_SaveThread()</tt><a id='l2h-918' xml:id='l2h-918'></a> and
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_RestoreThread()</tt> don't manipulate the lock; in this
case, <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_ReleaseLock()</tt><a id='l2h-919' xml:id='l2h-919'></a> and
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_AcquireLock()</tt><a id='l2h-920' xml:id='l2h-920'></a> are not
available.  This is done so that dynamically loaded extensions
compiled with thread support enabled can be loaded by an interpreter
that was compiled with disabled thread support.

<p>
The global interpreter lock is used to protect the pointer to the
current thread state.  When releasing the lock and saving the thread
state, the current thread state pointer must be retrieved before the
lock is released (since another thread could immediately acquire the
lock and store its own thread state in the global variable).
Conversely, when acquiring the lock and restoring the thread state,
the lock must be acquired before storing the thread state pointer.

<p>
Why am I going on with so much detail about this?  Because when
threads are created from C, they don't have the global interpreter
lock, nor is there a thread state data structure for them.  Such
threads must bootstrap themselves into existence, by first creating a
thread state data structure, then acquiring the lock, and finally
storing their thread state pointer, before they can start using the
Python/C API.  When they are done, they should reset the thread state
pointer, release the lock, and finally free their thread state data
structure.

<p>
Beginning with version 2.3, threads can now take advantage of the 
<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_*()</tt> functions to do all of the above
automatically.  The typical idiom for calling into Python from a C
thread is now:

<p>
<div class="verbatim"><pre>
    PyGILState_STATE gstate;
    gstate = PyGILState_Ensure();

    /* Perform Python actions here.  */
    result = CallSomeFunction();
    /* evaluate result */

    /* Release the thread. No Python API allowed beyond this point. */
    PyGILState_Release(gstate);
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that the <tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_*()</tt> functions assume there is
only one global interpreter (created automatically by
<tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt>).  Python still supports the creation of
additional interpreters (using <tt class="cfunction">Py_NewInterpreter()</tt>), but
mixing multiple interpreters and the <tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_*()</tt> API is
unsupported.

<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt class="ctype"><a id='l2h-885' xml:id='l2h-885'>PyInterpreterState</a></tt></b></dt>
<dd>
  This data structure represents the state shared by a number of
  cooperating threads.  Threads belonging to the same interpreter
  share their module administration and a few other internal items.
  There are no public members in this structure.

<p>
Threads belonging to different interpreters initially share nothing,
  except process state like available memory, open file descriptors
  and such.  The global interpreter lock is also shared by all
  threads, regardless of to which interpreter they belong.
</dl>

<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt class="ctype"><a id='l2h-886' xml:id='l2h-886'>PyThreadState</a></tt></b></dt>
<dd>
  This data structure represents the state of a single thread.  The
  only public data member is <tt class="ctype">PyInterpreterState
  *</tt><tt class="member">interp</tt>, which points to this thread's interpreter state.
</dl>

<dl><dt><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr valign="baseline"><td><nobr>void&nbsp;<b><tt id='l2h-887' xml:id='l2h-887' class="cfunction">PyEval_InitThreads</tt></b>(</nobr></td><td>)</td></tr></table></dt>
<dd>
  Initialize and acquire the global interpreter lock.  It should be
  called in the main thread before creating a second thread or
  engaging in any other thread operations such as
  <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_ReleaseLock()</tt><a id='l2h-921' xml:id='l2h-921'></a> or
  <code>PyEval_ReleaseThread(<var>tstate</var>)</code><a id='l2h-922' xml:id='l2h-922'></a>.
  It is not needed before calling
  <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_SaveThread()</tt><a id='l2h-923' xml:id='l2h-923'></a> or
  <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_RestoreThread()</tt><a id='l2h-924' xml:id='l2h-924'></a>.

<p>
This is a no-op when called for a second time.  It is safe to call
  this function before calling
  <tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt><a id='l2h-925' xml:id='l2h-925'></a>.

<p>
When only the main thread exists, no lock operations are needed.
  This is a common situation (most Python programs do not use
  threads), and the lock operations slow the interpreter down a bit.
  Therefore, the lock is not created initially.  This situation is
  equivalent to having acquired the lock:  when there is only a single
  thread, all object accesses are safe.  Therefore, when this function
  initializes the lock, it also acquires it.  Before the Python
  <tt class="module">thread</tt><a id='l2h-926' xml:id='l2h-926'></a> module creates a new thread,
  knowing that either it has the lock or the lock hasn't been created
  yet, it calls <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_InitThreads()</tt>.  When this call
  returns, it is guaranteed that the lock has been created and that the
  calling thread has acquired it.

<p>
It is <strong>not</strong> safe to call this function when it is unknown
  which thread (if any) currently has the global interpreter lock.

<p>
This function is not available when thread support is disabled at
  compile time.

Ensure that the current thread is ready to call the Python C API
regardless of the current state of Python, or of its thread lock.
This may be called as many times as desired by a thread as long as
each call is matched with a call to <tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Release()</tt>.
In general, other thread-related APIs may be used between
<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Ensure()</tt> and <tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Release()</tt>
calls as long as the thread state is restored to its previous state
before the Release().  For example, normal usage of the
Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS and
Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS macros is acceptable.

<p>
The return value is an opaque "handle" to the thread state when
<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Acquire()</tt> was called, and must be passed to
<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Release()</tt> to ensure Python is left in the same
state. Even though recursive calls are allowed, these handles

<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Ensure</tt> must save the handle for its call to
<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Release</tt>.

<p>
When the function returns, the current thread will hold the GIL.
Failure is a fatal error.

Release any resources previously acquired.  After this call, Python's
state will be the same as it was prior to the corresponding
<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Ensure</tt> call (but generally this state will be
unknown to the caller, hence the use of the GILState API.)

<p>
Every call to <tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Ensure()</tt> must be matched by a call to 
<tt class="cfunction">PyGILState_Release()</tt> on the same thread.
