1.2.1 Reference Counts 
</h2>

<p>
The reference count is important because today's computers have a 
finite (and often severely limited) memory size; it counts how many 
different places there are that have a reference to an object.  Such a 
place could be another object, or a global (or static) C variable, or 
a local variable in some C function.  When an object's reference count 
becomes zero, the object is deallocated.  If it contains references to 
other objects, their reference count is decremented.  Those other 
objects may be deallocated in turn, if this decrement makes their 
reference count become zero, and so on.  (There's an obvious problem 
with objects that reference each other here; for now, the solution is 
``don't do that.'')

<p>
Reference counts are always manipulated explicitly.  The normal way is 
to use the macro <tt class="cfunction">Py_INCREF()</tt><a id='l2h-10' xml:id='l2h-10'></a> to
increment an object's reference count by one, and
<tt class="cfunction">Py_DECREF()</tt><a id='l2h-11' xml:id='l2h-11'></a> to decrement it by  
one.  The <tt class="cfunction">Py_DECREF()</tt> macro is considerably more complex
than the incref one, since it must check whether the reference count
becomes zero and then cause the object's deallocator to be called.
The deallocator is a function pointer contained in the object's type
structure.  The type-specific deallocator takes care of decrementing
the reference counts for other objects contained in the object if this
is a compound object type, such as a list, as well as performing any
additional finalization that's needed.  There's no chance that the
reference count can overflow; at least as many bits are used to hold
the reference count as there are distinct memory locations in virtual
memory (assuming <code>sizeof(long) &gt;= sizeof(char*)</code>).  Thus, the
reference count increment is a simple operation.

<p>
It is not necessary to increment an object's reference count for every 
local variable that contains a pointer to an object.  In theory, the 
object's reference count goes up by one when the variable is made to 
point to it and it goes down by one when the variable goes out of 
scope.  However, these two cancel each other out, so at the end the 
reference count hasn't changed.  The only real reason to use the 
reference count is to prevent the object from being deallocated as 
long as our variable is pointing to it.  If we know that there is at 
least one other reference to the object that lives at least as long as 
our variable, there is no need to increment the reference count 
temporarily.  An important situation where this arises is in objects 
that are passed as arguments to C functions in an extension module 
that are called from Python; the call mechanism guarantees to hold a 
reference to every argument for the duration of the call.

<p>
However, a common pitfall is to extract an object from a list and
hold on to it for a while without incrementing its reference count.
Some other operation might conceivably remove the object from the
list, decrementing its reference count and possible deallocating it.
The real danger is that innocent-looking operations may invoke
arbitrary Python code which could do this; there is a code path which
allows control to flow back to the user from a <tt class="cfunction">Py_DECREF()</tt>,
so almost any operation is potentially dangerous.

<p>
A safe approach is to always use the generic operations (functions 
whose name begins with "<tt class="samp">PyObject_</tt>", "<tt class="samp">PyNumber_</tt>",
"<tt class="samp">PySequence_</tt>" or "<tt class="samp">PyMapping_</tt>").  These operations always
increment the reference count of the object they return.  This leaves
the caller with the responsibility to call
<tt class="cfunction">Py_DECREF()</tt> when they are done with the result; this soon
becomes second nature.
