1.3.2:

    Better handling of command line arguments to compiler.

    If not colorizing output, just exec the compiler to
    preserve the original STDOUT and STDERR.

    Removed STDIN kludge. STDIN is passed correctly now.

1.3.1:

   Added kludge to pass contents of STDIN to the compiler if we're
   not running from a tty. Some tools (imake) pass input on STDIN.

1.3.0:

   Modified the colorizing loop to be more strict. It was colorizing 
   text that looked almost, but not quite exactly like, warning
   and error messages.
	
   colorgcc was not exiting with the return code of the compiler process,
   confusing make. Fixed.

   Added a "Gotcha" section to the INSTALL.
	
   Added a CREDITS file.

   Added a COPYING file (copy of the GPL).

1.2.1:

   Applied patch to correct handling of escaped characters in compiler output.

1.2.0:

   First public release.
